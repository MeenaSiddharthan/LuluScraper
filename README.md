<p><b>Hi there you Lululemon shopaholic!</b></p>
Are you tired of mindlessly browsing WMTM only to end up with nothing?
Are you tired of clicking on an item with glee only to find your size unavailable?
Do you wish there's a quicker way to find that thing that's been on your wishlist forever?<p></p>

<p><i>Well here's something to feed consumerism!</i></p>
A little abrapythondabra that compiles every product on WMTM, original vs sale prices, colors and sizes available
at present in a jiffy!
All you have to do is install:
<p> requests, pandas, BeautifulSoup and Selenium packages</p>
& run it on your preferred python IDE!
