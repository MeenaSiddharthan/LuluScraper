<p><b>Hi there you Lululemon shopaholic!</b></p>
<p>Are you tired of mindlessly browsing WMTM only to end up with nothing?</p>
<p>Are you tired of clicking on an item with glee only to find your size unavailable?</p>
<p>Do you wish there's a quicker way to find that thing that's been on your wishlist forever?</p>

<p><i>Well here's something to feed consumerism!</i></p>
A little abrapythondabra that compiles every product on WMTM, original vs sale prices, colors and sizes available
at present in a jiffy!
All you have to do is install:
<p> requests, pandas, BeautifulSoup and Selenium packages</p>
<p> & run it on your preferred python IDE!</p>
